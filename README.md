### Overview

The SAT is standardized tests that many colleges and universities in the United States require for their admissions process. This score is used along with other materials such as grade point average (GPA) and essay responses to determine whether or not a potential student will be accepted to the university.

The SAT has two sections of the test: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing and Math ([*source*](https://www.princetonreview.com/college/sat-sections)). SAT have different score ranges and each colleges and universities have different score range for their admission ([*source*](https://prepmaven.com/blog/test-prep/average-sat-scores/#:~:text=As%20a%20whole%2C%20the%20average,1564%20for%20total%20SAT%20scores.)). You can read more about on their websites or additional outside sources (a quick Google search will help you understand the scores for [SAT](https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat) test)

Standardized tests have long been a controversial topic for students, administrators, and legislators. Since the 1940's, an increasing number of colleges have been using scores from sudents' performances on tests like the SAT as a measure for college readiness and aptitude ([*source*](https://www.minotdailynews.com/news/local-news/2017/04/a-brief-history-of-the-sat-and-act/)). Supporters of these tests argue that these scores can be used as an objective measure to determine college admittance. Opponents of these tests claim that these tests are not accurate measures of students potential or ability and serve as an inequitable barrier to entry. 

The digital SAT is a new version of taking SAT test for students. Instead of taking test with pencil and paper, students take the test on the computer ([*source*](https://newsroom.collegeboard.org/sat-program-results-show-increased-participation-class-2022)).

### Problem Statement

The digital SAT will be release in March 2024 for students in the United State. However, the numbers of students who took the SAT test was different from each states and the rate of students who participate in SAT test have changed each year. The purpose of this project is to explore the change of participation rate for the year 2018 and 2019 and identify states that have the SAT participation rate increased.
